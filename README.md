# balena-jetson-toolkit
This is an experimental project to run containers from [Nvidia NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/containers) on balenaOS Jetson devices.

Normally, these containers require the Nvidia [Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/overview.html) or Nvidia Container Runtime, neither of which are currently supported by balenaOS.

In the first part of this experiment, we run an Nvidia [L4T CUDA container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/l4t-cuda) on a Jetson Nano 4GB running balena OS 2.98.12

This is accomplished by mapping the devices into the container as detected by `strace` and then installing the L4T drivers....
